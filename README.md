# RPS
My first project using js!!

Here I am going to be using all the basics I have learned to created a classic game of rock , paper , scissors played against the computer in the browser console and adding some html and css later!
I will also be using psuedocode to create a baseline to start from / algorithm for step by step problem solving.
